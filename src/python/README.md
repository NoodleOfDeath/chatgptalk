# Python Backend Shit

Since it appears for now, I cannot avoid the use of python for ML here we are.

## Modules

Python will be used mainly for sentiment analysis and any other machine learning. The api will only be exposed internally to other resources in the app.

## Getting Started

I opted to use Poetry for package management which is more similar to npm and yarn. You will need to install the cli in order to work with this:

```shell
# mac
brew install poetry
# linux
sudo apt-get install poetry
```

Then run `poetry install` in this directory to install dependencies.

I can pick my sources, & it appears that the choices are growing. Which is appreciated. And you have reputable sources which is important to me. Recommend definitely.”',

This app is continuing to improve, and every update brings great features to the table. Finding and reading articles from various sources about the same topic is now so easy. I haven\'t found any app that functions or is as visually appealing as Read Less so you\'re missing out if you haven\'t downloaded it yet."',

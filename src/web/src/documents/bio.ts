# About the Developer

My name is Thom and I am a Full Stack Engineer based in Boston, originally from Northern Virginia. My journey hasn't been typical. At the age of 16, I sustained a spinal cord injury that significantly shaped my life and career. This experience gave me a unique perspective, helping me find creative solutions in both my personal and professional challenge

My foray into programming was as unconventional as it was impactful. My first program was a simple, yet useful, program on a TI-84 calculator written in C that assigned different sounds to each button, helping a visually impaired friend keep up with their studies. This project was my first step in realizing the power of technology to make a positive impact.

During my high school years, I embarked on projects that combined robotics with practical problem-solving, such as designing robots capable of retrieving items from challenging locations. My collegiate journey deepened this exploration, leading me to delve into the intricacies of automotive technology. I learned to integrate nodes into a car's Controller Area Network (CAN), pioneering alternate vehicular control methods.

As I matured, my aspirations evolved towards developing groundbreaking solutions for underrepresented communities, driven by a desire to create technology that offers tangible, daily value. This ambition culminated in February 2023 with the creation of 'Read Less'â€”a full stack application I developed within weeks end-to-end, inspired by the unveiling of the [unofficial ChatGPT API node library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chatgpt), a project I helped maintain until the openai library was updated to include completions. Initially a tool for my personal enlightenment, 'Read Less' quickly became a testament to my belief that to effect change globally, one must be well-informed about worldly affairs.

Today, I take pride in being more knowledgeable about current events than ever before. This journey of self-improvement and dedication to meaningful technology is what drives me as an engineer.

`## Watch out! There&apos;s a new(s) kid on the block (ü•Å, thanks for that one chatgpt)

theSkoop is the üóûÔ∏è app for people who:

- hate to read
- have ADD
- are too busy
- are tired of clickbait
- are tired of ads
- are tired of invasive notifications
- or, all of the above!

## What about theSkoop is so different?

Using the power of ChatGPT, theSkoop takes articles from popular news outlets and summarizes them into various serving sizes to fit your schedule and reading appetite!

## Yea, yea, what&apos; the cost?

The initial release of theSkoop as a web app and in mobile app stores will be entirely FREE! Eventually, we may scale to offer premium and/or beta services, but the ability to get up to date on current events that actually mean something to you, will always be free!`;

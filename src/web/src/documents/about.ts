# About the Developer

My name is Thom. I am a Full Stack Engineer living in Boston and originally from Northen Virginia. At the age of 16, I sustained a spinal cord injury, which in many ways has helped shape my success. This perspective has not only helped me find unique solutions to problems in my own life, but also in my work and personal projects.

I have been presented the opportunity to work through very unique problems, that I realize I never would have as an able bodied person; in fact, less than 3% of the population experiences trying to go up an icy ramp using a wheelchair with groceries on their lap, which I must say, is quite an amusing physics challenge once one is in it.

As I grew older, I wanted to create something unique that caters to underserved audiences and provides real value on a daily basis to users.

In February 2023, I developed Read Less in a matter of weeks, shortly after the debut of the unofficial ChatGPT API node library and mainly for myself because in order to make change in the world, one must know what is happening in the world.

I can proudly say, I am more informed than I ever have been about current events, and this is a skill I hope to continue honing.

# App Development and Operations

The app runs lean, with monthly infrastructure and API costs of around $450, soon to be cut in half when I switch to Mistral.

Tensorflow is run on CPU to resolve topics, and stable diffusion is used to generate images for articles without media.

Sentiment analysis is currently done through lexical analysis and the use of large language models; however, a key ambition is to develop a specialized multimodal sentiment analysis neural network that will allow users to customize their news feed with very granular sentiment filters.

For example, users will soon have the option to limit how much disturbing, triggering, catastrophic, and/or controversial content they are presented with per day.

This sentiment analysis model is already under development and will leverage user feedback, lexical analysis, and large language models as potential supervisory components.

Ideally, users will scroll through the app for only 15 minutes a day, then can feel confidently informed enough to make meaningful impact.

Plans for monetization include a subscription model for additional features (such as daily word games) in order to reach self-sustainability without heavy reliance on investors.

So why reach out to OpenAI?  Well, with over 2,000 unique sign-ups - all achieved without marketing - it's clear that there is a demand for what we offer. 

In fact, we are up against the founders of Instagram and their very similar platform called Artifact, which was released the same week as Read Less.

Additionally, our journey mirrors that of OpenAI: starting with a noble mission and recognizing the need for sustainable growth to prevent potential missteps by others. 

With Read Less, I aspire to explore content discovery algorithms that, rather than echo viral or extreme views, foster open-mindedness and critical thinking, paving the way for a platform and brand that promotes this ethos.

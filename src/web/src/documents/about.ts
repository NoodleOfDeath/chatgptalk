# About the Developer

Ny name is Thom and I am a Full Stack Engineer based in Boston, originally from Northern Virginia. My journey hasn’t been typical. At the age of 16, I sustained a spinal cord injury that significantly shaped my life and career. This experience gave me a unique perspective, helping me find creative solutions in both my personal and professional challenge

My foray into programming was as unconventional as it was impactful. My first program was a simple, yet useful, program on a TI-84 calculator written in C that assigned different sounds to each button, helping a visually impaired friend keep up with their studies. This project was my first step in realizing the power of technology to make a positive impact. 

During my high school years, I embarked on projects that combined robotics with practical problem-solving, such as designing robots capable of retrieving items from challenging locations. My collegiate journey deepened this exploration, leading me to delve into the intricacies of automotive technology. I learned to integrate nodes into a car's Controller Area Network (CAN), pioneering alternate vehicular control methods.

As I matured, my aspirations evolved towards developing groundbreaking solutions for underrepresented communities, driven by a desire to create technology that offers tangible, daily value. This ambition culminated in February 2023 with the creation of 'Read Less'—a full stack application I developed within weeks end-to-end, inspired by the unveiling of the [unofficial ChatGPT API node library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chatgpt), a project I helped maintain until the openai library was updated to include completions. Initially a tool for my personal enlightenment, 'Read Less' quickly became a testament to my belief that to effect change globally, one must be well-informed about worldly affairs.

Today, I take pride in being more knowledgeable about current events than ever before. This journey of self-improvement and dedication to meaningful technology is what drives me as an engineer.

# App Development and Operations

The app runs lean, with monthly infrastructure and API costs of around $450, soon to be cut in half when I switch to Mistral.

Tensorflow is run on CPU to resolve topics, and stable diffusion is used to generate images for articles without media.

Sentiment analysis is currently done through lexical analysis and the use of large language models; however, a key ambition is to develop a specialized multimodal sentiment analysis neural network that will allow users to customize their news feed with very granular sentiment filters.

For example, users will soon have the option to limit how much disturbing, triggering, catastrophic, and/or controversial content they are presented with per day.

This sentiment analysis model is already under development and will leverage user feedback, lexical analysis, and large language models as potential supervisory components.

Ideally, users will scroll through the app for only 15 minutes a day, then can feel confidently informed enough to make meaningful impact.

Plans for monetization include a subscription model for additional features (such as daily word games) in order to reach self-sustainability without heavy reliance on investors.

Wwith over 2,000 unique sign-ups - all achieved without marketing - it's clear that there is a demand for what we offer. 

In fact, we are up against the founders of Instagram and their very similar platform called Artifact, which was released the same week as Read Less.

I believe our journey mirrors that of OpenAI: starting with a noble mission and recognizing the need for sustainable growth to prevent potential missteps by others. 

With Read Less, I aspire to explore content discovery algorithms that, rather than echo viral or extreme views, foster open-mindedness and critical thinking, paving the way for a platform and brand that promotes this ethos.

# TheSkoop Client

[![Client CI](https://github.com/NoodleOfDeath/theskoop/actions/workflows/client-ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NoodleOfDeath/theskoop/actions/workflows/client-ci.yaml)

This is the client for the TheSkoop project

## Getting Started - TL;DR Style (aka Docker)

If you want to skip the workspace setup process, you can run the local docker image via docker compose (hot reloads will be slightly slower than using `pnpm run dev`):

```bash
src/client $ docker compose up
```

The Skoop (formerly ChatGPTalks) is the model for a fully automated user content-driven podcast pipeline that is powered by ChatGPT.

The goal is to provide a template that allows users to collectively interact with ChatGPT in so-called "channels" and direct the dialog in an informative/entertaining way that brings the most value to all participants.
